hour
=======

React Native Application
-----------

hour is a mobile application allows users to locate special hours for food and drinks nearby or specified location.

Features
-----------
* Search - check for specific foods or drinks
* Map - find what is around you with the map! Icons display type and color coded to signify how much time is left before the specials end
* User accounts - create an account to bookmark and create reviews
* Bookmarks - save your favorite places or use it to make it later!

This project is an exercise for me to create an application from something I've personally wanted to see. Happy hour specials are always a 
good way to get away from a long days work to socialize and relax. Using Yelp's API, hour would always be up to date with business information.
Opening hour eliminates from having to search using other resources and displays only locations that do have specials. Getting reviews from 
other users to inform other users if there are specials that do not show up on their websites or through Yelp's own 'special-hour' filters.

Technologies use for creation:
* React-Native
* Node.js
* MongoDB
